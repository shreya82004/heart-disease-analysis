# 🫀 Heart Disease Analysis

This project explores a heart disease dataset to uncover insights into the factors that contribute to heart-related health risks. Using Python and data visualization tools, the analysis identifies patterns and potential indicators of heart disease.

---

## 📌 Purpose
To analyze heart disease data and identify key factors that influence the likelihood of heart disease in patients.

---

## 🧪 Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

---

## 📊 Key Steps & Highlights

- ✅ Cleaned the dataset by removing duplicate entries and checking for null values.
- 📈 Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on features such as age, sex, chest pain type, cholesterol, blood pressure, and more.
- 🔥 Used heatmaps and correlation matrices to find relationships between features and the target variable.
- 📉 Visualized distributions using count plots, histograms, and KDE plots for demographic and clinical factors.
- 💡 Found strong associations between chest pain type, cholesterol level, maximum heart rate, and heart disease risk.

---

## 🧠 Insights

- Most patients were aged between 40–65.
- High cholesterol, low max heart rate, and higher ST depression (oldpeak) are commonly associated with heart disease.
- Certain chest pain types (especially "asymptomatic") were more frequent in heart disease-positive cases.
- Males showed a higher incidence rate compared to females in the dataset.
